# Micropython-MicroQueue

MicroQueue is a Python module that allows you to use Redis as a message queue.  The resulting message queues
are compatible with those provided by the python hotqueue/redislite-hotqueue modules when used with the json
serializer.

This code is written to work properly in conjunction with the micropython-redis module to allow operation on
embedded platforms.
